**Project Description: Patient Wait List Dashboard**

**Overview:**
The *Patient Wait List Dashboard* is an interactive Power BI project designed to derive actionable insights from a healthcare dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains approximately 200,000 rows of patient wait list information, split into two categories: **Inpatient** (patients admitted to the hospital during treatment) and **Outpatient** (patients treated without hospital admission). This project provides an in-depth analysis of patient wait times, historical trends, and specialty-level statistics, offering valuable insights for healthcare management and decision-making.

**Key Features:**
1. **Current Patient Wait List Status Tracking**: Monitor the real-time distribution and volume of patients on the wait list, categorized by inpatient and outpatient status.
2. **Historical Trend Analysis**: Visualize monthly trends in patient wait times, enabling a better understanding of historical patterns and seasonal variations in both inpatient and outpatient categories.
3. **Specialty and Age Profile Analysis**: Gain detailed insights into specialty-specific patient wait lists and demographic profiles (age groups, adult vs. child).
4. **Top Recurring Specialties**: Identify the specialties with the highest patient wait list volumes, providing insights into areas with potential resource allocation challenges.

**Technical Process:**
- **Data Preparation**: The dataset was preprocessed to ensure data quality. Each category (inpatient and outpatient) was transformed individually to address inconsistencies and improve usability.
- **Table Merging**: The transformed tables were merged into a consolidated dataset for unified analysis.
- **Dashboard Design**: The Power BI visualization consists of two pages:
  - **Summary Page**: Highlights the main insights through visually engaging charts and graphs.
  - **Details Page**: Provides detailed, number-based information about the data and insights for granular analysis.

**Interactive Experience:**
Download the **"Patient Wait List Dashboard.pbix"** file to experience the dashboard in its original form using Power BI Desktop. This interactive format allows users to explore the insights dynamically, customize views, and drill down into specific details.

**Audience:**
This project caters to both technical and non-technical audiences. Healthcare professionals can leverage the insights for operational improvements, while data analysts and Power BI enthusiasts can explore the technical aspects of dashboard creation and data visualization.
