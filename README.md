**Project Description: Patient Wait List Dashboard**

**Overview:**
The *Patient Wait List Dashboard* is an interactive Power BI project designed to provide actionable insights from a healthcare dataset sourced from Kaggle. This dataset includes approximately 200,000 rows of patient wait list information split into two categories: **Inpatient** (patients admitted to the hospital during treatment) and **Outpatient** (patients treated without hospital admission). The dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of patient wait times, historical trends, and specialty-level statistics, assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

**Key Features:**
1. **Current Patient Wait List Status Tracking**: Visualize the real-time distribution and volume of patients on the wait list, segmented by inpatient and outpatient categories.
2. **Historical Trend Analysis**: Track monthly trends in patient wait times to identify historical patterns and seasonal fluctuations in both inpatient and outpatient data.
3. **Specialty and Age Profile Analysis**: Conduct detailed assessments of specialty-specific wait lists and demographic breakdowns, including age profiles (adult vs. child).
4. **Top Recurring Specialties**: Highlight specialties with the highest patient volumes, helping identify areas for resource optimization.

**Technical Process:**
- **Data Transformation**: Both inpatient and outpatient datasets were transformed individually to improve data quality and consistency.
- **Table Merging**: The transformed datasets were merged into a unified table to enable holistic analysis.
- **Dashboard Design**: The Power BI dashboard comprises two pages:
  - **Summary Page**: Showcases the primary insights through dynamic charts and visualizations.
  - **Details Page**: Provides detailed numerical data and insights for users requiring granular analysis.

**Files Included:**
1. **"Patient Wait List Dashboard.pbix"**: The Power BI file that can be downloaded and opened with Power BI Desktop for an interactive exploration of the dashboard.
2. **"Dashboard Pictures"**: A set of images showcasing the dashboard layout and insights for quick reference.

**Audience:**
This project is designed for a diverse audience, including healthcare professionals seeking operational insights and data analysts exploring advanced Power BI techniques. The clear and concise visualizations ensure accessibility for non-technical users, while the detailed data structure caters to technical stakeholders.
